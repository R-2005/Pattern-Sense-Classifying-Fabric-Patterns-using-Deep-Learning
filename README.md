# Pattern-Sense-Classifying-Fabric-Patterns-using-Deep-Learning
Pattern Sense involves using deep learning to automatically classify fabric patterns such as stripes, florals, or plaids. By training neural networks on labeled fabric images, the system learns to recognize and differentiate complex visual textures, aiding in textile design and inventory management.
